(AI Agentic Architecture and Cognitive Architectures)
(SOAR Cognitive Architecture)


- Agents have been around since the 50s (Checkers)
- Agent: someone who can make autonomous decisions
- Agents "do work"

Business strategies: how do we organize a business around AI?
An organization where "the backbone" is undergirded by advanced technology

Different approaches to Agents:
    1. Cognitive agents: automated reasoning
    2. Processing Automation; ie, robot vaccum: experiential learning)
    3. Autonomous Entities Simulation (videogames)
    4. Language understanding

Machine Learning (ML) vs Cognitivie Tech (CT)

ML:
- data centric
- requires structured data

CT:
- experience based
- structured knowledge based


# What makes AI so special

- The human mind is a general purpose instrument. 
- it can learn

Agents are designed to be general purpose as a variant of "cognitive technology":

Attributes of Cognition and Computation Cognition:
attention
knowledge
memory
judgment 
reasoning
problem solving
decision making
compreshension
language learning

We desire a software architecture which can implement these various elements of cognition:
memory: database
reinforcement learning: knowledge

Agents are different than Machine Learning:
- percieve their environment: vaccums, games,
- affects the environmentimage.pngimage.png
- Brain Fn that does automated reasoning
- Has "working memory" which uses "reasoning cycles"; ie, paying with cash at grocery store calculating "can I afford this"
- Uses declarative programming (how) versus imperative (what)
- Learns and Improves on its own

For example:
1. Automated planning
2. Inference Engine
3. Cognitive Architecture

A modern chat bot is an agent with a specific architecture:
LLM
Memory (redis/chat history)
Actions (tools)

Article Publishing: research, writing, publishing

Episodal memory/semantic-memory

Question:

1. What is the difference between an agent versus and LLM that uses function caling?
2. To what extent is the expontential growth in hardware tech attributable to the current AI hype and so on
3. AGI: comes to us behavioral
