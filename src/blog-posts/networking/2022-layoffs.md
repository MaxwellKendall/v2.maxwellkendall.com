The recession has effected multiple peers within my network. This page is dedicated to serving as a reference on their behalf. The following colleagues of mine are experienced, competent professionals in the software industry.

Please do consider connecting with them and let me know if there's any further context I can provide as far as my working experience with them goes!

Thank you!

1. [Jonathan Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-hill-07a429a7/) - Senior Software Engineer
   I worked with Jon on USAspending.gov for almost two years. He is an excellent developer in both delivery and estimation. We collaborated with other engineers, the OPS team, design, clients, and product owners throughout the entire development life cycle. His work ethic, ability to learn, and eagerness are strong assets to any team.

2. [Sai Mohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saikrishnamohan/) - Senior Software Engineer
   I worked with Sai at MURAL for about 6 months on the same team. We paired together on multiple projects delivering features for our Enterprise clients. Sai was critical in delivering MURAL's [eDiscovery feature](https://developers.mural.co/enterprise/docs/about-ediscovery). With his help, this feature unlocked the ability for international corporations to fully adopt MURAL resulting in various multi-million dollar deals for the company. Sai's attitude, aptitude, and reliability are strong assets to any team.

3. [Justin Kwok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmkwok/) - Senior Engineering Manager
   I worked with Justin for over a year at MURAL. As a Senior Engineering Manager, he worked seamlessly with Product, Engineering Architects and VPs, as well as Individual Contributors such as myself to set expectations for company OKR's each quarter. His technical capacity coupled with his clear, respectful communication are a rare combination which help bridge the various gaps between Product and Engineering. Justin's experience and clear communication skills make him a strong asset to any team.
