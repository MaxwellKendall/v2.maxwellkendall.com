# Andrew Carrell Wedding Speech

Good evening everyone. My name is Max and I’m Andrew’s Best Man. I met Andrew at Church when he first moved here to Charleston and now here we are together on his wedding day. God has smiled on us. This is a special couple. I’m so very pleased to be here celebrating this happy occasion. What a beautiful day, an amazing venue, great food and drinks, and happy people all around!

With that in mind, let’s give a round of applause to the Mother and Father of the bride for putting on this fantastic wedding tonight for Mr and Mrs Carrell.

(pause)

Thank you both so much for letting us share in the joy of this happy occasion. I’d also like to add my thanks to the entire Carrell family. I have very much enjoyed getting to know all your sons over this weekend and very much enjoyed Andrew’s friendship since he moved to Charleston. He is a fine young man and I am sure will be an excellent husband.

So when Andrew first moved to CHS, he was single. We met at Church one Sunday. A couple days later I guess it turns out we were also neighbors and went to the same gym. One day we were both in the gym and we were like “oh hey man, you’re the guy from Church. You live around here?” and so on.

So one day very shortly after that he tells me he’s got a date. That was it. It was Emily. I’m pretty sure I was like “so how did it go man” and he told me he liked her. He was gonna bring her to Bible Study. I was like oh wow she got a Bible Study invite already? Dang. He must like her. So I was excited to meet her. But turns out I wasn’t there that night or something so I think I missed it? I was pretty bummed cause I was like who is this girl or whatever. Then one day sometime later I’m in the gym and I see Emily and Andrew walking bye on the street outside — cause remember Andrew is my neighbor — so Andrew sees me in the window. I give him a big wave and smile and I guess somehow was trying to express like “Oh thats her” so somehow she just gives me this great big smile and I’m giving like this big wave and smile back and all that kind of thing just being like “oh my boy likes you!!” So I guess I pretty much met her through this kind of silent interaction through a window. But somehow it was still very animated and warm and friendly. It was through a gym window while they were walking down the street. It was a sweet moment. A bit later I’m like, “Wow that wasn’t really awkward at all.” Which was hard to believe. I’m pretty sure most people would’ve made that interaction super awkward. It’s not really appropriate to wave like that to people you’ve never met but I just went for it and Emily totally rolled with it and made a great impression. For all of you who know Emily this isn’t hard to imagine. Is it?

Well, since then, we watched Andrew fall in love with Emily. Andrew would come over and we’d be like, “Where’s Emily?” Really they are both two gentle, kind, loving people. It’s hard to imagine a better match. It has been a joy to watch them grow in their love for one another and make their vows today.

Andrew, I’m so happy for you. God has blessed you with such a loving family, many friends and today, a loving wife. God has done the same for me. We are brothers. It has been a great blessing to walk by your side through various trials over the past few years and it is such a joy to celebrate with you today this marvelous blessing. And God has blessed us in this way not only so that we would have joy and happiness, but so that others would also know the same joy. Just as that old German Monk once said:

> There is no more lovely, friendly, and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.

That is certainly true in the case of you and Emily. All of us here today have been blessed to know your friendship as singles, but we will enjoy even greater happiness now that you are united to one another in marriage.

So let us all raise a glass to toast Mr and Mrs Carrell:

May your love for one another only grow stronger from this day forward and may you enjoy a long, happy marriage, the presence of our great God, your loving family, and your many friends.
