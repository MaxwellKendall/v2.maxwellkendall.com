Psalm 33:18-19:

> Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love, that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine.

Proverbs 16:1

> The plans of the heart belong to man,
> but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.
> All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,
> but the LORD weighs the spirit.
> Commit your work to the LORD,
> and your plans will be established.
> The LORD has made everything for its purpose,
> even the wicked for the day of trouble.

> and go late to rest,
> eating the bread of anxious toil;
> for he gives to his beloved sleep.
