The Union of Christ with his beloved Church is so precious and intimate the Church is a synechdodce for the Savior himself. (Saul, Saul why are you persecuting me?) Likewise in Holy Communion, the bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ as synechododce. 

The synechdodce is a common feature of human language. It appears in Holy Scripture. Some, in their zeal, have mistaken synecdochal language for ontological proposition.

In the same way we don't confuse the city of Washington with their football team when we say "Washington is trash" at 5pm most Sundays in the fall, the Church is witness to Christ through Word and Sacrament, not Christ Himself. The elements of Holy Communion in the hands of the Holy Spirit become Christ himself clothed in his promises to the eyes of faith, all while remaining mere bread and wine.

This has been your healthy dose of cursed protestant nonsense.
