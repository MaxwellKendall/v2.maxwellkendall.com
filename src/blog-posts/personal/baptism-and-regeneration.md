Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob always regarded their children as those within God's covenant. Notice how this is God's Name in Genesis: "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob". This harkens back to the promise given to Abraham, "I will be a God to you and your offspring after you." This inclusion of Abraham's offspring was confirmed by requiring the sign of this covenant, circumcision, to be applied to male offspring on the 8th day. Romans 4:11 teaches us that this sign was of the utmost spiritual significance and far from being merely a seal of temporal, earthly blessings.

Indeed, the promise, "I will be their God" runs throughout the entire scriptures and is reaffirmed as one of the defining features of the new heavens and new earth. (Revelation 21:3) It is a summary of what it means to be united to Christ and a recipient of all the blessings in him. To withhold circumcision from the male offspring was considered a great sin and a repudiation of the covenant. (Genesis 17:4, Exodus 4) By inference, to withhold baptism is likewise a great sin and repudiation of God's grace.
Understanding this context of redemptive history reorients the question away from "are our children regenerate" to "did God change the manner in which we are to regard our children?" The answer to the latter question is clear. (Mark 10:14, Luke 18:16, Acts 2:39, 1 Corinthians 7:14, Ephesians 6:1-4) As Dr. B.B. Warfield has noted, our position is very simple: God has put the children of believers in the church and nowhere put them out.

As it regards the former question, regeneration is a great mystery which is ordinarily realized through the instrumentality of the Word preached. That said, God is free to work in any manner he pleases such that we know at least one person, John the Baptist, was alive to Christ in the womb as he leaped when near to him. (Luke 1:41) So wisdom leads us to not presume either way. The question itself assumes a level of knowledge that is beyond us. Our assurance of our own hearts waxes and wanes, how then can we confess others to be regenerate? We have hope and faith in this of course, but wisdom cautions us away from such questions. A better question is "Do I possess a credible profession of faith?"

As to your follow up question, of course we view children outside the church the same as their parents. They are outside of the covenant. Applying baptism to children of believers does not confer a new status to them, but rather it conveys a pre-existing status. Namely, that they are in covenant with God in a way that the children of those who worship wood and stone are not. The word of God is efficacious. The children of believers are subject to its power. They are taught by the most preeminent authority figures in their lives to pray and look to Christ. God, of course, knows this. He is the sovereign author of this fact for all covenant children. It is his normative manner of working to use the institution of the family, along with the Church, to bring the elect to Christ.

Many baptists think they are exalting the significance of conversion to Christ, but they are actually minimizing it by failing to recognize that God's salvation is intended and designed to extend beyond oneself to one's children, children's children, children's children's children, etc, etc, etc... God promises as much. (Exodus 20:6, Deuteronomy 7:9) The non-paedobaptist position also implies that faith precedes grace, when the reverse is the true doctrine of salvation.

There is much to say about all this. Overall, we are taught to honor our children. To deny them the sign of the covenant which they are in is a great sin and repudiation of God's grace.
