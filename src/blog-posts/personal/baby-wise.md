Goal of the book is `confidence for mom and dad and abiding security for their baby`.

## Chapter 1: The Home Environment

> Falling in love with your baby is no the same thing as providing your baby a loving home environment. A healthy home environment starts with Mom and Dad's commitment to each other, from which a more perfect love is communicated to their children.
> A loving home environment is not something that naturally emerges. It takes work and sacrifice and it requires both Mom and Dad be intentional in their love for each other.

Three Prevailing Influences that shape Children:
1. Genetic Disposition.
2. Personality
3. The Home Envrionment Created by Mom and Dad

> The marriage relationship provides children with a layer of love and security which cannot be achieved through the direct parent-child relationship -- even during the baby years... (Therefore...) it is not helpful to the baby (to have a family dominated by the parent-child relationships)... Thus, the greatest overall influence parents have on their children comes not in their roles ans individual parents, but in their shared role as husband and wife.

Once the baby arrives:

1. Continue living life! Life does not stop once the baby arrives. It may slow down for a few weeks, but it should not stop entirely.
2. Date your spouse -- continue having weekly date nights
2. Loving gestures should not only be extended to the baby
4. Daily Time together
5. Know what to expect of eachother before your baby arrives.

## Chapter 2: Feeding Philosophies
> A new borns desire to satsify hunger is one of the strongest in life.
> The feeding phiosophy a mother and father decide to implement will produce an ever-expanding series of ripples taht impact every aspect of a baby's life... Every feeding philosophy brings with it a different set of parenting priorities and opinions about what is best for a baby, although there is no consensus about what best means or how it is acheived. That is because each parenting priority is driven by larger worldvies and beliefs related to children, their origin, nature, and basic needs.

### Clock Feeding / Behaviorism
> ENV stimuli are primary influence on baby. 
- Every 4 hours, feeding despite any hunger cues 

### Child-Led Feeding
- Attachment theory -- a "perfect emotional" relationship exists in the womb and is restored
- Birth is traumatic
- Feeding is beyond the value of breastmilk

### Parent Directed Feeding

> Behaviorists are extreme in emphasis regarding outward stimuli, Child-Led folks are extreme in emphasis of inward person at the expense of outward structure; the solution in Parent Led Feeding is the center.

- Less fautiguing for Mom
- Center point between hyper scheduling and re-attachment theories
- Proposes sleep is very important
- Aims for healthy growth and optimal development

For example, learning requires alertness -- alertness depends on sleep.

Depends on acquisition of confidence for `parental assessment` born of experience with the child.

#### The Composition of A Single Variable and Single Constant

`Variable`: Hunger Cues
`Constant`: Schedule

Consideration of only the variable results in maternal exhaustion & cluster feeding; consideration of only the constant results in the ignoring of legit hunger cues and low milk supply due to lack of stimulation from baby. (Two leading causes mom quits breast feeding: exhaustion and low milk)

```text
Feeding time = Hunger Cue + Schedule + Assesment
```

Variable holds more weight than the constant. The orderliness provided by the constant facilitates `attachment cohesion` where the baby is healthy
enough and developing strong enough to thrive relationally with mom and dad.

### Defining `Attachment` with Seven Criterion

Attachment is best defined using `objective markers relevant to developmental inclinations`. Baby's are born with needs. The parent needs to satisfy these!

1. Feed-week-sleep cycles are predictable
2. Sleep without props
3. Seel through the night 8-10 hours
4. Predictable naps
5. Content wake-times and self play
6. Self soothing 
7. Accepting of multiple care givers

#### Signs of Attachment Anxiety
9, 12, 18, 24 month who is:

1. Not sleeping through the night
2. Not napping
3. Cannot self soothe
4. Anxious alone / away from Mom
5. Discontent alone / cannot self play

ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† These are parent induced defecits.

## Chapter 3: Sleep
Weight lifters know this -- to grow you need both fuel (feeding) AND sleep (growing). You actually grow during `sleep`. Not when you eat.

> Healthy sleep habits and healthy growth are connected.

Suggested Goals:
1. Full term babies at `7 - 10 weeks` are born with capacity for 7-8 hours of continuous sleep 
2. By `12 weeks` they can sleep 10-12 hours

> These acheivements require parental guidance and basic understanding of how a baby's routine impacts healthy outcomes.\

### Facts
1. "Babies do not have tha ability to organize their own days and nights into predictable rythms, but they have the biological need to do so. That is why parents msut take the lead and create `structure` and `routine` for their babies and for themselves.

This is why `Parent Guided Feed-Wake-Sleep` cycles are essential! 
> The more consistent the routine, the more quickly a baby learns to adapt and organize his feed-wake-sleep rhythms. Established rhythms lead to continuous nighttime sleep.

2. In `Feed-Wake-Sleep` Quality is Equivalent in Importance to Order
Very, very important. Very good, reasonable quote! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
> Mom must work to make each feeding a `full feeding` Babies are prone to doze off thereby taking only a partial meal. When that happens, the child is not taking enough to satisfy his nutritional needs. When Mom works with baby on this, it eventually leads to `productive waketimes`. A good waketime impacts nap time, and a good napper is a better feeder. In turn, optimal sleep in a 24 hour cycle impacts optimal alertness, which improves cofnitive functionality that increases brain growth, and encourages a host of other neurologic benefits. Where does it all begin? With the first stone, when the baby receives a high-quality feeding.

3. Feeding Patterns Emerge
> From birth onward, hunger patterns organize into predictable, stable, and regular periods or become erratic and unpredictable.

> Babies have an inate ability to organize their feedings into a predictable rhythms and will do so if encouraged by Mom's feeding philosophy. Hunger mechanisms (digestion and absorption) responds to feedings with `metabolic memory`. Routine feedgins encourage Baby's hunger metabolism to organie into predictable cycles. Erratic feedings or `clusters of feeding` discourage this.

`metabolic memory` is hurt by erratic feeding. 

For example:
> the Mom who follows a `cry-feeding` philosophy may feed him at 8am and 30 minutes later when her baby cries, she feeds him again. An hour may pass and he feeds, followed by 3 hours before the next feeding, then 20 minutes. The next day, everything is different. Including the legnth of each feeding cycle and the timing of each cycle. When there is no considtency in the amount of time between feedings, and this pattern continues for weeks, it is very difficult for the feed-wake-sleep cycles to stabilize. As a result, these babies have difficulty establishing stable and uninterrupted nighttime sleep. Waking as often as every 2 hours on a recurring basis. This pattern may continue for two years or more according to some studies. Not surprisingly, formula-fed babies who are not on a routine usually end up with the same results. Take note of the next fact.

4. What goes into the mouth is not as important as when it goes in
> Our study on breastmilk vs formula for moms using PDF resulted in little difference (my words)

### Norms and Statistics for Sleep under PDF
Based on study of 550+ babies, some exclusively breast fed, some exclusively formula fed, some with medical conditions.

#### Routine Feeding and Sleep Defintions
- Breast fed: Every 2.5 - 3 hours
- Formula fed: Every 3 - 4 hours
- Routine Sleep: 7 - 8 hours of continuous sleep

| Category             | Age               | % Sleeping through the Night |
| -------------------- | ------------------| ---------------------------- |
| breast fed boys      |  7 - 9 weeks      | 76.8                         |
| breast fed boys      |  12 weeks         | 96                           |
| breast fed girls     |  7 - 9 weeks      | 86.9                         |
| breast fed girls     |  12 weeks         | 97                           |
| formula fed boys     |  7 - 9 weeks      | 78.3                         |
| formula fed boys     |  12 weeks         | 95.7                         |
| formula fed girls    |  7 - 9 weeks      | 82.1                         |
| formula fed girls    |  12 weeks         | 96.4                         |
| w. meidcal condition |  13 - 16 weeks    | 100                          |

> 80% of babies began sleeping through the night on their own without any further parental guidance apart from routine feedings. It just happened. There were some periods of night crying by the remaining 20# of infants. Most of that took place over a three-day period and the crying was between 5-35 minutes in the middle of the night. On average it took three to five days for a nine week old baby to break the old patterns of waking during the night and `to acquire the skill of sleeping through the night`

> The typical infant has the natural ability to sleep through the night sometime by the end of the second month of life. It is an acquired skill enhanced by routine.

ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®
> Dr. Lews M. Terman ... looked at 3K children... `children who were found to have superior intelligence had one common link: all of them had experienced healthy and usstained nighttime sleep from early infancy until the day they were tested`... In 1983 Terman's studies were objectively repeated by Canadian researches and the same conclusions were reached...

### Sleep Cues

> The natural sleep cue is sleepiness. Parents introduce subsitute cues called `sleep props` which interfere with the baby's ability to fall alseep on their own.

Sleep props to avoid:
1. Intentionally nursing your baby to sleep
2. Motion and Vibration
> For instance, rocking chair. the question here is not whether you should rock or cuddle your baby... but are you using theses as sleep props?
3. Sleeping with your Baby

> Where should my baby sleep? ... your newborn will need to feed at least every 3 hours.
PROs of sleeping with baby in your room:
1. Convenience for nighttime feedings
CONs:
1. Baby noises keep new parents up wondering if they're ok
2. Sharing a room after four weeks can postpone a baby's ability to sleep through the night upward to four months.

## Chapter 4: Facts on Feeding
> Feeding a baby is perhaps the most basic task of infant management.

> Breast milk decreases the incidence or serverity of
1. diarrhea
2. respiorty infections
3. cacterial meningitis
4. UTIs

> ... also protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, allergic diseases, Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis, and other chronic digestive diseases.
> Breastmilk is easily digested, gives exceelent nutrition, contains the right balance of protiens and fats, and also provides additional antibodies for building a baby's immune system. We believe there are health benefits to breast milk that are yet to be discovered.

It also is most healthy for Mom:
1. Enhances the uterus to its normal size and shape
2. Facilitates postpartum weight loss
3. reduces risk of breast cancer
4. reduces risk of type 2 diabetes
5. reduces risk of osteoporosis later in life

### Difference between Cry-Feeding and PDF
> Responding promptly to hunger cues is key to both approaches, but PDF requires full feedings every 2.5 - 3hrs rather than many small partial feedings clustered together. Working to acheive `full feedings` is a key to PDF success.

Distinction can be described as that between "qualitative feeding" and "quantitative feeding".

Things to keep in mind relative to cues:
> Hunger cues always trump time on the clock
> Mom's fatigue should also be a cue -- something needs to change
> Fatgiued babies do not nurse  well. (healthy sleep facilitates healthy feeding and -- in turn, healthy growth)
> If a full feeding doesn't always happen, don't panic, remember it is `a goal` to work toward

### Milk Supply
Demand prompts supply. 8 - 10 times per day will produce the same amount of milk as 12-20 times. Dont over do it.

### Characteristics of `Full Feeding`
1. Adequate amount of time 10-15 minutes per breast / 20-30 minutes for bottle
2. Hearing the swallowing of milk
3. Baby pulling away from breast/bottle when satiated
4. Burping well after feeding
5. Good naps

Avoid `snack or cluster feedings` as they will work against "the synchronozation of hunger rhythms."

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
> There is also a health risk. The more a baby snacks, the less nutrition he receives; the less nutrition he receives, the greater the health risk. They key to efficient milk production for full feedings is the combination of proper breast stimulation with an appropriate amount of time between feedings. `Breast stimulation refers to the intensity of a baby's suck, whcih is driven by the baby's hunger. The strength of this drive is directly related to the time needed for the milk to digest and for absorption to take place. Typically, infants fed on a 2.5 - 3hr routine have a stable digestive metabolism and demand more milk than babies who periodically snack throughout the day.

### Don't forget about mom!!
> Nothing is more basic to breastfeeding success than taking care of mom's nutritional needs... epsecially proper hydration... too much water in a 24 hour period (more than 12 8 oz glasses) can potentiall harm your milk supply. Warning signs that Mom is not drinking enough water include thrist, concetrated urine (deep yellow) and constipation. For your baby's sake and your own health -- stay hydrated!

### Hind and Fore Milk
Hindmilk is the good stuff, foremilk is the diluted stuff at the beginning. (Lots of detail on page 66/67)

### Nursing positions
> Proper latching requires the baby's entire body, head, chest,stomach and legs aligned and facing mom's breasat. If the head is twisted away from his body, then the baby will not be able to nurse efficently. Imagine trying to receive a drink from someone standing behind you with your head sideways. Your esophagus is pinched at the point where your head is turne.d that is what it is like whe na baby is not aligned properly on his mother's breast.

Three main positions: cradle, side-lying, and football hold. Most common is the cradle position. 

### How often should I nurse?
> Always feed a hungry baby! ...On average for the first month do once every 2.5 - 3 hours... Feedings are best measured from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next. 

Feeding duration: 20 - 30 minutes
Total wake/sleep time post feeding: 2 hours

> With these averages in place you will have 8 - 10 feedings a day in the early weeks, which falls within the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

> An infant's natural inclination is to organize his feeding into predictable cycles early in life.

### Time Ranges in a Baby's Day
> Babywise recommends ranges rather than specific times

| Baby Activity | Time Range  |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Feeding       | 2.5 - 3 hrs |
| Napping       | 1.5 - 2 hrs |

Keeping this range helps both (a) baby's nutritional needs and (b) mom's lactation

Deviation from these ranges should be the exception, not the rule!

### Milk Phases 

colostrum -> transition -> mature

First milk is yellow and think called `colostrum` and gives to the baby extra protien.
Baby's first stool is greenish black, sticky, and comprises everything from the uterus

> Within 2-4 days, a breastfeeding mother starts to produce `transition milk` which can last from 7 - 14 days. The content of this milk has less protien but an increase in fat, lactose, calories, and water-soluble vitamins

> Mature milk is composed of foremilk and hindmilk; the former satisfying the baby's liquid needs... hindmilk is released after several minutes of nursing and it is similar in texture to cream and has high levels of fat that are necessary for weight gain and brain development. 

### More facts
Prior to mature milk....
> Breast tenderness is not uncommon. this is because the baby sucks harder to receive the colostrum. A typical pattern is "suck, suck, suck, swallow." When mature milk becomes available, your baby responds with a rhythmic, "suck, swallow, suck, swallow, suck, swallow." at that point, the hard sucking is reduced, and the tenderness should cease.

> How quickly babies eat varies
> Milk may be delayed in a mother due to `c-section`, `stressful-birth`, `IV-fluids and medication used during labor`, `premature delivery`, `maternal diabetes` or `obesity`.
Alternatively, factors that assit in healthy milk production in mom include:
1. Early (soon after birth - preferably in the first 1-2 hours)
2. Frequent (8-12 times per 24 hours)
3. Effective (good latch with effective suckling)

#### The very first nursing period
> There will only be one! Take a moment to enjoy the miracle of life and that you have the ability to feed the child. Your baby will know what to do. Most babies are alert for the first hour and a half after birth making it the ideal time to bring the baby to breast. An initial time of 10-15 minutes per side will allow for sufficient breast stimulation. Remember, the first thing to stay mindful of is the proper positioning of the baby which helps facilitatee proper nursing and prevent soreness. For this first and the next several feedings, nurse as long as you feel comfortable, staying mindful that `both breasts need to be stimulated at each feeding`

#### The Sleepy Baby
Newborns need to be fed every 2-3 hours! Sleepy or not they must eat!

> How can you get them to stay awake long enough to get a full feeding?
1. Hold him skin to skin (only a diaper on)
2. Massage face, rub feet
3. Change diaper
4. Gently speak to him
5. Be creative!

### Baby's Lose Weight Right After Birth
They were born with extra weight and the in-uetero stool. 
> Parents should know their baby's weight at the time of discharge and time of birth!

### How do I know my Baby is Getting Enough Food?
- 5 - 7 wet diapers per day after the first week
- 3 - 5 yellow stools daily for the first month
- Consistent weight gain

Use the "Healthy Baby Growth Chart" in the appendix and fill them in religiously!

### First 7 - 10 Days
> Mom and baby really find their equilibrium. Precious moments not be concerned about scheduling sleep or feeding routines and the clock.

Work toward the goal of getting in a full feeding at each feeding! After this period, they should be able to transition to a consistent 2.5 - 3 hour feeding routine. 

Feedings might last from 30-40 minutes

Limit the use of a pacifier.

### Growth spurts
- They usually require additional feedings or they become hungry sooner than 2.5 hours after the last feeding.
- Can last from 1-4 days -- fatiguing mom

### Burping Your Baby
During a feeding, they swallow air and will be uncomfortable unless we burp them.
- Burping is an acquired skill so be gentle and cautious of the intensity 
Positons:
1. Sitting lap position
2. Tummy over lap position
3. Shoulder position
4. Cradle Position


## Managing your Bab'ys Day (Use App for Specific Schedule)
A baby's routine must be established _before_ flexibility is introduced to the Baby's day.

Three activities of babys routine are 
1. Feeding Time
2. Wake Time
3. Naptime

With age appropriate modifications, these same three activites continue thorought the first year and constitue a "feed-wake-sleep cycle".

We _merge_ the changing needs of the baby from one growth stage to the next by making small adjustments to the schedule that allows us to drop a feeding time.

> Babies "Drop feedings" because they are either sleeping longer or staying awake longer. The act of "dropping a feeding" is part of the larger merging process and requires that some adjustments be made in a baby's daily routine

### Guiding Principles to Merging Cycles
> "First-last"... No matter what "merge" is taking place, when adjusting a baby's routine, the first feeding is always strategic. Without a consistent time set for the first morning feeding, a baby may feed every three hours, but each day's routine will be different. That is not good for baby or Mom. While ther can be some flexibility to this first feeding time, try to keep it within a 20 minute time frame.
> "Time variation" ... Not every cycle is the same length once you get beyond the newborn stage; for instance at four months of age, some may be 2.5 hours, some may be 3.5. This is normal.
> "Capacity and Ability"... baby's do not have the ability or capacity to arbitrarily drop a cycle.
> "Individuality" ... obviously each kid is different
> "Two steps forward, one step back" ... most merges take four to six days before a "new normal" is established.

### First Month Principles
> If you need to awaken your baby during the day to prevent him from sleeping longer than the three hour cycle, do so. Such intervention is necessary to help stabilize the baby's digestive metabolism and help him organize his sleep paterns into a predictable routine.
> During the first month, a baby may give Mom and Dad a 4-hour stretch at night, but do not let the baby sleep longer than 4 hours. Wake your baby, feed him and put him right back down to sleep. An infant under four weeks of age is too young to go much longer without food. 
### Waketime and the First Three Months
> Your baby's feeding time _is_ his wake time, because that's all a newborn can handle before sleep overtakes his little body. Usually bye weeks 2 or 3 most babies fall into a predictable feed-wake-sleep routine. When this happens, you and your baby have arrived at another level of success.

#### Birth to Two Weeks
Over two to three hours:
- Feeding time / Wake Time: 30-50 minutes
- Sleep: 1.5 - 2hours

> NOTE: Feeding time is basically the baby's wake time. 30 to 50 minutes include feeding, diaper change, burping, and any hygiene care necessary, (plus cuddles and kisses)

### Three to Five Weeks
Over 2.5 to 3 hours
- Feedtime / Wake time: 30-60 minutes
- Sleep: 1.5 - 2 hours

> NOTE: Around week three you will notice that waketimes are starting to separate as a distinct activity and may last up to 30 minutes... With good feedings and healthy sleep habits, a new level of alertness emerges that requires additional thought and planning.

### Six to Twelve Weeks
Over 2.5 to 3.5 hours::
- Feedtime: 30 minutes
- Wake time: 30-50minutes
- Sleep: 1.5 - 2 hours

Very important! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
> NOTE: By week 12, wake times could be 60 minutes or longer. By then, your baby should be sleeping through the night... DO NOT ALLOW `wake-feed-sleep` to overtake `feed-wake-sleep`! ...Baby is now feeding after a waketime when `he has less energy to feed effeciently`... It is not a big deal if this happens once or twice (due to almost no waketime and short nap where baby wakes up after having just fed recently); however, if this begins to repeat itself off and on, even for acouple days, then Baby's routine will begin to reflect a `wake-feed-sleep` cycle. Here is the problem with that routine. Inadequate waketimes lead to insufficient sleep, resulting in shorter naptimes; shorter naps lead to inefficient feedings, and from there everything falls apart. That is why feedings, in the early months, should follow after naps and not wake times.

Very important ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†

### General Principles
> Consider context, be considerate of others. Your baby's routine is not the most important thing in the world. Consider other people.

> Other people -- like nursery workers in church -- should not be obligated to follow your baby's routine

Flexibility is okay so long as there is a routine that is established. Unforseen things occur and we have to be flexible as circumstances require:
> Thoughtful parental responses determine whether a child is a blessing to others or a source of mild irritation.

> At the heart of the Parent Directed Feeding plan lie three basic infant activites: baby feeds, baby is awake, baby sleeps. Matching baby's needs with apretnal care is all about the process of learning how to proactively love your baby.

## Chapter Six: Waketimes and Naps
Wake times is when you notice the most change

### Activities
1. Feeding & Touch
> Touch is important because it is the first language of newborns is one they need and crave... while they do not need to be held 24/7 or have constant skin-to-skin contact with mom, they do need to be held by many members of the community... The more hand sthat communicate love through touch the more secure the child.
2. Singing
Never to early to sing. Kids recognize our voices and the sound of our voices and the ways words can be used
3. Reading
> Never to early to read and show him colorful, tactile books that he can expore on your own
4. Bath Time
5. Playing
> The best part of waketime is when you get to cuddle and play with people, such feelings of love cannot be replaced
6. Walking
> Baby cannot walk, but his parents can! Going for a stroller lide and fresh air is great fun for Baby. Good for strollers to face outward so he can see the world around him take in new sights and so on.

#### Alone time
> Some monitroed alone time provides critical opportunities for learning... We do not mean leaving baby out of sight, but rather providing opportunities for him to investigate his world without being constantly entertained.

You can do this via:
1. Infant seat: elevated so he can see things
2. Bouncy seat: Designed for baby who can hold head upright without support, usually at 3 - 4 months.
> Keeping baby upright for 10-15 minutes after each feeding helps food to settle and minimizes spitting up.
3. Tummy time:
On blanket, on belly.
> can begin once he is able to hold his head up consistently, usually between 12-16 weeks
> Since SIDS prevention requiring babies to sleep on their back, more `plagiocephaly` has occured (flatenning of baby's head)... Tummy time has become a preventive counter-measure to correct the deficiencies (neck strenghth motor skills and so on are also affected by sleeping on back) of the supine (on back) sleeping arrangement
> An ideal time to have tummy time is shortly after feeding while he is alert and happy, but not before a nap, when he is tired and may fall asleep.
> Best place is on Mom or Dad's chest
> Must be planned for the welfare of your baby
> Most pediatritaions recommend 30 cumulative minutes (or longer) of tummy time each day.

Playpen good for when we're busy

### Naptimes
> While sleep training doesnt happen til four weeks of age... they will do so passively by establishing a good feed-wake-sleep routine.

Weeks:
- 1 - 2: 5-6 naps (17 - 19 hrs of sleep per day) 
- 3 - 5: 5-6 naps (16 - 18 hrs of sleep per day)
- 6 - 7: 4-6 naps (15 - 18 hrs of sleep per day)
- 8 - 12: 4-5 naps (14 - 17 hrs of sleep per day)
- 13 - 15: 3-4 naps (13 - 17 hrs of sleep per day)
- 16 - 24: 3-4 naps (13 - 16 hrs of sleep per day)
- 25 - 38: 2 - 3 naps (13 - 15 hrs of sleep per day)
- 39 - 52: 2 naps (12 - 15 hrs of sleep per day)

> Allowing a baby to cry for no reason does not make sense, but when you factor in whats best for hte baby, such as healthy sleep training, then crying at naptime has a purpose. It is not a meanignless exercise to test a parents reosl,ve but a decision to help your baby achieve the multiple benefits that come with being well rested. Think of a little crying as an investment twoward a lucrative gian. The benefit will be a baby who goes down for a nap without fussing and wakes up rested and as a result alert, ready to learn, happy and content. It is a good tradeoff for Baby, Mom and Dad.

> Crying for 10, 15, or even 20 minutes will not harm your baby physically or emotionally... Who wants a fussy baby who is high-need, never satifsfied, unable to soothe himself, and living in a state of discontentment?

> Healthy sleep has two primary components taht most parents are unwilling to give up: a baby who sleeps through his naps without waking andone who sleeps in his crib for those naps.

When a baby wakes up in the middle of a sound nap, see page 123.

> Over stimulating a baby during wakteime impacts the next set of feedings and naptimes.

## When Your Baby Cries

> All babies cry without any apparent cauase. NEwborns routinely cry a total of 1 to 4 hours a day. No mother can console her child every time he cries, so do not expect to be a miracle worker with your baby.

> Think of crying as a signal, not a statement against your parenting.

> The ability to _read_ your baby's cry will give you confidence in parenting, but waht are the keys to decoding your Baby's signal?

> Babies whose parents supressed their cries could not overcome the simplest obstacles separating them from their parents.

The goal isn't to stop your baby from crying, but to learn what the crying means

> The key to responding to a baby's cry is understading the context not just the cry itself -- there are six cry times during the first five months:

### Abnormal Times of Crying
1. During a feeding
- Milk okay?
2. Immediately After a feeding
- trapped gas, burp them
- mom's diet -- spicy food?
- milk quality -- lactate issue?
3. In the middle of a sound nap
- sleep issue? Routine okay?

### Normal Times
4. Just before feeding (he's hungry)
5. During Early Evening
- most baby's are just fussy during this time.
- is he hungry?
6. When going down for a nap
> Most babies cannot fall asleep without crying and will go to sleep more quickly if left to cry for a while (American Acadmaey of Pediatrics or "AAP")
> Sometimes tyou may think they're waking up when they're just in light sleep. Or they might be waking up for a second only to drift back. It's best to just let him cry for a bit, then he'll fall asleep again and you'll be fine (paraphrase, AAP)

> If your baby cries more than 15 minutes, check on him. Remember, you are training your baby how to sleep, not "how to not cry"
> Become a student of your child's cry patterns

### Cries to listen for
> A high-pitched, piercing cry may be a signal of either internal or external bodily injury. If persistent, should be brought to attention of a doctor
> A marked change in cry patterns may indicate an illness

### Responding to your Baby's Cry
1. Think about where he is in his routine
2. Listen for the type of cry
3. Take action
> Sometimes best action is no action; if he's clean, fed, and ready for naptime, let him learn to sleep without your help
> Sometimes you just need to hold him for a second and reassure him. But blocking your childs cry al lthe time because you cannot handle the sound of the cry shouldn't be one of the reasons to pick him up
