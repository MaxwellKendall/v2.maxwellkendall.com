March 2000 â€” no deals after May 2000
November 2021 â€” peak

In both 2000 and 2021 â€” blistering pace/growth
Decrease/fall is not the same
in 2008, not a bubble

2000 - 30 months to bottom

- no demand from portfolio companies

2021 â€” where is the bottom?

- still a demand from companies

Cant predict where markets are going

Cost and access to captial depends on

- Gross Margins 60% vs 90% is huge
- Rentention and acquisition are most important verticals

Later stage companies are harder to fundraise right now ðŸ¤¦
