## Introduction

No one can make a pencil. So goes the argument in the classic essay “[I, Pencil](https://fee.org/ebooks/i-pencil/).” The key observation of the essay is that pencils, common as they may be, are in fact exceedingly complex; in other words, they are made up of many parts from diverse groups across the world. Given this observation, an obvious question emerges. How in the world did it come to be that such a complex creation is ubiquitous?

Could it be that there is some “master-mind” behind it all? Perhaps some experts harvest the wood, mine the graphite, create the rubber, paint the wood, and apply the brass plating all by themselves? While plausible, it is not so.

The correct answer raises us to the enchanting realm of wonder: the pencil came from free people collaborating without any intent of creating a pencil. The deeper question, then, becomes how is such collaboration among diverse groups accomplished without self-conscious intent? The lack of intent excludes this collaboration arising from “good will”, “coordination”, or “wisdom.” It suggests rather a more fundamental motivation which gets a bad rap: self-interest.

In other words, the reason free people collaborate together to accomplish such marvels as the mass production of pencils is because conditions were such that doing so was to their own advantage. This is perhaps one of the simplest and most obvious observations one can make about human society: folks typically act according to their own self-interest. We are rarely more motivated to work than when we are working for the benefit of ourselves. Is this a bad thing? Maybe, but not always. For example, if one cannot care for themselves, how can they care for others? There is good rationale for looking out for ourselves. The golden rule assumes this very point as its foundation “love your neighbor as you love yourself.” Self-interest, or self-love, is a vice only in excess. Self-interest weighs heavily upon our psyches and acknowledging this fact is wise. It may go against the grain of noble sentiments but is in fact a foundational assumption of the golden rule itself.

Given the (sometimes very cynically portrayed) admission that we are all acting in some degree or another with our own self-interest at all times, and this is neither necessarily a bad thing nor (more remarkably) a mutable characteristic, an approach to collaboration design can be conceived which seeks to make the best of this fact. Acknowledging our own self-interest as both ineradicable and morally-neutral lays a foundation upon which we can erect a social-system of rewards, penalties, and information-sharing which has the potential to introduce behavior which is simultaneously self-interested and productive.

## Incentives: Directing Self Interest to Mutual Benefit

The social-system which rewards, penalizes, and dictates how information is shared is regarded by some as the most important subject of analysis when seeking to understand the cause of outcomes within society. This system may be referred to in shorthand as the "incentive structure.” In society at large, this would be the public policies, laws, and taxes of a given people; especially their collective impact on the price of goods and services. To produce pencils on such a mass scale, a diverse set of specialists – wood harvesters, graphite producers, brass-workers, rubber manufacturers and so on – must be encouraged to work together. Furthermore, a “pencil factory” must assume the risk of assembling these diverse materials and bringing them to market at a desirable price.

Without specialists focused on contributing their individual piece of the pencil there would be no chance for a “pencil factory” to exist at scale. Without the factory(s), there would be no value to the work of the specialists. Both must exist and work together in harmony within the larger context of conditions where doing so is mutually beneficial.

This mass availability of pencils is a modern marvel. The same point can be made on any number of modern luxuries such as the air conditioner, motor vehicle, television, cell phone, newspaper, computer, and so on. This is mass collaboration of specialists at scale. Many have argued that the ingenious force behind it all is the calculus of human self-interest operating within a prime regulatory environment.

## Application

From this economic discourse we can draw direct lines of application to software engineering in at least three parts.

First, the incentive structure can be seen as the common practices of our engineering culture. What is rewarded? What is penalized? What is our primary way of communication? What sort of behavior do these practices encourage? What sort of outcomes does this behavior likely result in? What are alternative rewards, penalties, and ways of communicating we could practice? What would such alternatives encourage? What would such behavior predictably result in?

Second, the existence of “specialists” (brass-workers, wood harvesters) can be seen as critical to our scale. We need “backend” specialists. We need “cloud-engineering” specialists. We need “frontend” specialists. We need “machine learning” specialists. And so on. They are critical to our success. However, we must also recognize that not everyone must necessarily be so narrowly focused on a single specialty. We need “pencil-factory” operators who know “a thing or two” about brass, graphite, and wood.

Third, we can recognize that collaboration between specialists is hard. This is one of the most difficult parts of software engineering: cross-domain collaboration. It is a particular sore spot, I believe, for many engineering teams. One way forward is to interrogate our “incentive structure” until we see our specialists are serving our generalists: in other words, specialists devoting themselves to the creation and maintenance of documentation and abstractions that are idiomatic and intuitive. Doing this results in specialists multiplying themselves in others so that more can serve in that domain. Documentation can also be an artifact of simply helping others. Those who are helped can contribute and express their thanks for the help by becoming contributors not only to the code itself but to the documentation.

Lastly, we can recognize that specialization is not the only (or perhaps even sufficient!) aspiration for software engineers. Put positively, there is value in being a generalist. [Many people within the engineering world have recognized this](https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html). I have made it a personal aspiration
myself and find great satisfaction in learning new things and broadening my skill set. It should also be mentioned that specialization and generalization are not mutually exclusive. One can be a specialist in one domain and a generalist in another.
