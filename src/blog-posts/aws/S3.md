**Security**
Object storage in AWS is encrypted in transit by default, but not at rest.

**Encryption at Rest**

- Client side: Strictest form of encryption — requires client to manage the encryption/decryption process.
- SSE-C:
  - S3 manages everything but the keys — not stored in S3 — which must be provided in every PUT/GET.
- SSE-S3
  - S3 manages everything including keys, which are present in the bucket in an encrypted format; IAM users with S3 access don’t require keys to access and decrypt.
- SSE-KMS
  - S3 performs encryptions using KMS, IAM users with both S3 and KMS access can decrypt.

## Storage

AWS S3 provides 11 9s of durability across all storage tiers, except the one zone tier with 99.5% durability, with availability varying across storage tiers.

- **Durability: 99.x9s%** _durability_ across all storage tiers
  - Except in One Zone Tier where availability drops to **99.5%**
- **PUTS per Second**: 3500
- **Buckets per account**: 100

**Storage Tiers**

- Standard
  - **99.99%** Availability
- IA
  - Requires Rapid retrieval (w/in seconds)
  - **99.9%** availability
- One Zone IA
  - **99.5%** availability
  - Only one AZ
- Intelligent Tiering
- Glacier
  - **Retrieval Time** mins-hrs, configurable
- Deep Glacier
  - **Retrieval Time** w/in 12 hrs
  - Retention period 7-10 years

## Upload

**Transfer Acceleration**

- Upload to Cloudfront edge location; then propagate to bucket in associated region

**Multipart Upload**

- recommended at 100MB; required at 5GB

**Cross Region Replication**

- Only one way - origin/destination bucket

## Migration to S3 via Upload

**Gateways**
Full alternative or supplement to on-premise storage.

- **File Gateway**
  - Storing/retrieving files via NFS/SMB Protocol
-     **Volume Gateway**
  - Stored as Elastic Block Store Snapshots
  - **Cached** retain only part of data set (recently accessed); entire data set is in S3.
  - **Stored** retain data set; data set backed up for DR.

## Replication of Objects

Does not retroactively replicate objects.

**Overview:**

- Charges apply per GB retrieval: IA/OZIA/Glacier/Deep Glacier
- Migrating to S3
- Tiers of S3
