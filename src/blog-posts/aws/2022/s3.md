S3 is a collection of buckets which operate as Key-Value Object Stores:

```javascript
{
    "Your File Name": YourFile.jpg // in bytes
    "metadata": {
        "content-type": "jpg",
        "last-modified": 10000243
    },
    "versionId": "GUID"
}
```

S3 Bucket names are globablly unique, surprisingly. URL patterns are like this:
https://:nameofbucket.s3.:region.amazonaws.com/:keyName

So if literally anyone has :nameOfBucket, only they can have it. Period. Full stop!
