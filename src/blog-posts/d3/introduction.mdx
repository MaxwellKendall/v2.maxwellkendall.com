Data Driven Documents (d3) is generally considered the industry standard for data visualization in the browser.
The basic task which I use d3 for is the proportional mapping of a set or `domain` of input values to a designated set or `range` of output values.

Here are a few examples:

### Linear Mapping

```javascript
import { scaleLinear } from 'd3';

const linearScale = scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range([0, 1]);
```

In this case, we can now invoke `linearScale(5)` and receive a return value between 0 and 1 which represents the proportion of the integer `5` between 0 and 100; namely, `0.05`.

### Quantize Mapping:

```javascript
import { quantizeScale } from 'd3';

const quantizeScale = scaleQuantize().domain([0, 100]).range(['red', 'blue']);
```

What this will do is designated the input `quantizeScale(1)` as either `red` or `blue`.

### Time Scales

D3 also has a scale for handling time.

```javascript
import { linearScale } from 'd3';

const timeScale = linearScale()
  .domain([new Date(1990, 04, 04), new Date()])
  .range([0, 1]);
```

What this will do is take a date as an input, `timeScale(new Date(2019, 04, 04))`, and tell us what percentage of time the given date is relative to the provided scale.

### Overview

What these methods do is demonstrate for us one high level feature of d3, which I find most useful. That is,
mapping input values to a specified output value. This can be very useful in illustrating relative or comparative data.

D3 is very powerful. There will be more posts to come on the various ways that it can bring data to life!
