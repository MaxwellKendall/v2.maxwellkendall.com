## üëã Intro

Hello, world!

Most of what I have acheived thus far in my career is a direct result of the kindness and generosity of others who were willing to help, guide, and teach me. As I get more experience, I not only hope to continue to learn from **_all_** of those around me, but to pass on what I have learned.

So please do not hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:maxwell.n.kendall@gmail) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwellkendall/) if anything is incorrect, unclear, or unaddressed.

Most of all, I hope this site will connect me with people with and from whom I can learn and continue to grow as a software engineer.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Max
